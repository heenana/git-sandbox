ls -a //shows hidden files and folders
git verb obj adj
git status //diff bw working copy and the head
git commit -m "commit message"
HEAD = current commit
what was index = 
git add path1 [...pathN]
git log: shows current branch 
--oneline 
Untracked
-node modules installed at build time -- dont want to track those things - leave these untracked 
-metadata
cd
git init
git status
git add --all
git status
OR git add -all && git status //two commands in one line

Working Directory -- Index -- HEAD

COMMANDS
ctrl+a / ctrl e: beginning/end of line
ctrl+< / ctrl+>: move one work at a time
ctrl+w delete a word at a time
ctrl+r: search command history
ls -l : vertical not horizontal display plus extra stuff (like aliases)
ls subdir 
ls / look at root dir
pwd: tell you which directory youre in (print working directory)
-r: remove a directory
touch: update last modified date on file or create file if it doesnt exist
~ : home directory (cd ~/project)
!$ :  last argument to last command ('echo !$') //useful so dont have to retype path
alias gs="git status", then run gs
~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile

git log : display history of commits (each has id)
git cat-file -p unique-ID :display contents of certain nodes

git checkout path
-resets files to match working copy of snapshot
-will destroy uncommited changes
-use this to abandon work and go back to HEAD
-abandoning work -forget what i had out there, get me back to the head
-make working copy look like head
-will modify physical files if theve been edited
-will restore physical files if theyve been deleted
-not vise versa - physcial files whose logical files have been deleted just show up as untracked
-more on checkout coming later

git commit --amend
-replaces the snapshot with the current staging area
-modify, add, or remove anything - new snapshot
-even if no index change, message updates
-use freely, but only on last commit

git clean path
-removes untracked files from path
-wont actually delete without --force/-f
-wont delete directories without -d
-common form: git clean -df .

git reset
-changes where head points to 
-may alter staging and working copy to get there

git reset [commit] [path]
-this form changes index to match commit
-does opposite of git add (git rm more like git delete)
-commit optional, defaults HEAD
-path optional, interactive if omitted
-used it to back out items from staging

git reset --hard path
-changes staging area AND working copy
-will destroy all uncommitted changes

Branches
-branches are labels pointing at chains of commits
Master
-default branch is named master
-primary, stable branch by convention
-nothing special about it, except 1st commit has no parent

git branch [name] : creates new branch
git checkout branch-name : switchs to specified branch

git checkout -b branch-name (better than git branch branch-name because it conncts to the branch)
